# Data Structures

Data structures are organized ways of **storing and managing** data within a programming language. It is essential to understand these terminologies to respond clearly when questioned on the topic.

The role of data structures is to structure and organize data, enabling efficient management. An example is the **list**, which may or may not be ordered, such as the list of admitted students in a university entrance exam, where the order of candidates is relevant.

Another classic example is the queue, which follows the **FIFO** (First In, First Out) rule, where the **first element to enter is the first to leave**, like a bank queue. The stack, on the other hand, follows the **LIFO** (Last In, First Out) principle, where the **last element to enter is the first to leave**, like a stack of books.

Additionally, there are structures such as **trees**, used in file systems to organize directories and subdirectories, and **tables**, which organize data into rows and columns, as seen in databases.

The primary data structures include:
- integers
- real numbers
- characters
- boolean values (true/false)
- character sequences. 

**Some languages handle characters and strings differently.**

Beyond basic structures, it is possible to create custom structures to represent specific entities, such as a customer, with attributes like code (integer), name (string), status (active/inactive), and registration date (composed of integers for day, month, and year).

Each programming language may have different approaches to data typing. Some are more flexible, allowing variables to assume different types during execution, while others require the type to be defined and maintained.

Understanding and correctly using data structures is fundamental for developing efficient and well-organized applications.
